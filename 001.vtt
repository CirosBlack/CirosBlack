Hey, this is Chris Plush from cgmasters.com, and here we go again.

00:05.380 --> 00:09.340
In this course we'll be modeling and rendering a custom car designed by concept designer

00:09.340 --> 00:13.440
Lee Rosario, and this includes a full interior.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.280
This car design has every challenge I wanted for a course to teach everything I have to

00:17.280 --> 00:19.440
teach on this subject.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.560
And I was way more than happy to be able to use this design, so big shout out to Lee,

00:23.560 --> 00:26.560
and you can check out his work at the links on the screen.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.320
Now if you've taken my other car courses before, you'll be happy to know that I've perfected

00:30.320 --> 00:34.560
the guide mesh techniques I teach, including a super simple and totally reliable technique

00:34.560 --> 00:37.880
for adding thickness without applying any modifiers.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.380
And whether you've seen my courses before or not, definitely check out the full guide

00:41.380 --> 00:45.080
to the guide mesh chapters in the next section to learn more about that technique and to

00:45.080 --> 00:46.680
see what's new.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.460
And finally, you can follow me on Twitter for updates on the course and any new projects

00:50.460 --> 00:54.240
I'm working on, and if you have any trouble going through this course, you can email me

00:54.840 --> 00:59.200
at chris.cgmasters.gmail.com and I'll help you out.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.360
And that does it for this chapter, so I'll see you in the next one.
